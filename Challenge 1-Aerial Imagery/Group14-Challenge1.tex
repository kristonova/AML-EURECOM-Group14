\begin{abstract}
This report describes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to classifying satellite images 
into classes with or without cacti. The dataset is composed of aerial imagery and labeled as 
containing a cactus or not. We demonstrate data processing steps, model design, and experimental 
results. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Remote sensing and aerial imagery have become important data sources across many fields, including 
agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Our main objective is to detect 
specific objects, in this case cacti, within image patches. We explore a supervised learning 
paradigm, training a CNN to distinguish images that contain cacti from those that do not.

\section{Data Analysis and Preparation}
The dataset consists of labeled images in JPEG format. Each image is paired with a binary label 
indicating cactus presence (1) or absence (0). We split 80\% of the data as a training set and 20\% 
as a validation set. Before feeding images into the model, they are resized to a consistent shape 
(e.g., 32$\times$32 pixels). We also applied random transformations such as flips and rotations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Train-Validation Split:} Ensures an 80:20 partition.
\item \textbf{Data Augmentation:} Horizontal/vertical flips and slight rotations.
\end{itemize}
These steps help reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

\section{Modeling Approach}
We implemented a simple CNN using layers of convolution, pooling, and a final dense classifier. Our 
model was compiled with the cross-entropy loss for binary classification.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
As an example, below is a short code snippet illustrating the core of our CNN definition (in Python/Keras):
\begin{verbatim}
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
\end{verbatim}

We trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer, monitoring both training and validation accuracy.

\section{Results}
After training, the model achieved high accuracy on validation data. Figure~\ref{fig:acc_plot} 
illustrates the training and validation accuracy curves over epochs. The final validation accuracy 
stabilized around 97--98\%.

\subsection{Discussion}
The CNN consistently improved classification performance during training, with signs of slight 
overfitting in later epochs. Nonetheless, data augmentation and dropout proved effective in 
maintaining robust performance. If further performance improvements are required, one could explore 
deeper networks or advanced regularization techniques.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a CNN-based approach to classifying aerial images for cactus presence. The final 
model achieved strong results, indicating that lightweight CNNs can effectively handle this 
binary classification task on relatively small 32$\times$32 images. Possible future work includes 
testing more sophisticated network architectures and tuning hyperparameters to further improve 
generalization.
